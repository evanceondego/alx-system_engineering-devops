Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a PID
What is a process
How to find a processâ€™ PID
How to kill a process
What is a signal
What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-what-is-my-pid
4120
sylvain@ubuntu$
2.Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
Display in a user-oriented format
Show process hierarchy
2.Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

You cannot use pgrep
The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)
3.Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:

You cannot use ps
4.Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:

In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2
5.We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You must use kill
Terminal #0
6.Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You cannot use kill or killall
Terminal #0
7.Write a Bash script that displays:

To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

Terminal #0
8.Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0
